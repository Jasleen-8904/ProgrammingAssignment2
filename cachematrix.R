## These functions collectively provide a caching mechanism for matrix inversion. 
## The makeCacheMatrix function creates a matrix object with methods to set and 
## get the matrix, as well as to set and get its inverse. 
## The cacheSolve function computes the inverse of a matrix using caching to 
## improve performance by storing and retrieving previously computed inverses.

## This function 'makeCacheMatrix' creates a closure that stores a matrix 'x' and its inverse 's'. 
## It provides methods to set and get the matrix, as well as to set and get its inverse. 
## This is useful for caching the inverse of a matrix to avoid redundant calculations when 
## performing matrix operations.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix(sample(1:100,9),3,3)) {
        s <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    s <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setsolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
  getsolve <- function() s
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsolve,
       getsolve = getsolve)
}


## This function 'cacheSolve' computes the inverse of a matrix using caching. 
## It checks if the inverse of the matrix is already cached; if so, it retrieves it. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse, caches it, and returns it. This caching 
## mechanism helps in avoiding redundant computations when calculating inverses of matrices.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        s <- x$getsolve()
  if(!is.null(s)) {
    message("getting inversed matrix")
    return(s)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  s <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(s)
  s
